<< Abandoned Shore - Day 2 >>I found a shack near the shore. It looks abandoned and weathered,but will do the job. I'm still very tired, as i didn't sleep last night at all.What could have happened to me?? Where am I? What is this place?There is some bread and roasted fish on the table. I hope i won't die from poisoned food. Later i will look around in the shack, but first of alli have to sleep a bit...and get myself together, tomorrow i MUST go fora walk on the beach.
