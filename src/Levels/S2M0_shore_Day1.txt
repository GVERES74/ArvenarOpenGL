<< Abandoned Shore - Day 1 >>Dear Valentine,By the time you read these rows, i'm likely already far away.Ten years ago i suddenly disappeared from our house,i can not even remember what actually happened, i only remember pain, and despair, looking for you and your brother,but....but you were nowhere to be found.I found myself here, on a deserted beach, alone and very tired.But i have to get up and walk, looking for shelter and food..."Storm is coming over the ocean, and nightfall is almost here.
